switching RTL in the Unity Editor And Run Time + Create Camel Case For Function Names... or to write in arabic,hebrew,persian and so... there are two main scripts almost the same. one is the editor script and the other for runtime. you can use the function SwitchRTL("the text to turn sides"); for changing the text during runtime.

I'm using String Builder using Linq ; you can also just import a package to your project or open this project.

im using it to write classes names before i go to unity to open a new class. why? becouse then i need to change the name twice. in VS studio and the editor.

how it works: open the editor from the window menu. It will appear under windows/Change Text Direction RTL. and dock it .

write inside the bar for example : kill all prefabs from older scenes. then press camel case -> killAllPrefabsFromOlderScenes and capitalise first letter KillAllPrefabsFromOlderScenes then copy the result when you create new script unity new script -> paste it. done.
